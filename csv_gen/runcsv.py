# CSV Report Generator
# --------------------
# This script is designed to pull vulnerability data from Security Center 4.2
# and format it into a CSV file.  While Security Center can already do this,
# this script will also break out the Plugin Text field into individial fields
# before generating the CSV row.  Once the report has been generated, the
# script will then compile and email and send the email off to the email
# associated to the asset list in question.
